Description: Provides users with its associated functions for pedagogical purposes in visually learning Bayesian networks and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computations. It enables users to: a) Create and examine the (starting) graphical structure of Bayesian networks; b) Create random Bayesian networks using a dataset with customized constraints; c) Generate Stan code for structures of Bayesian networks for sampling the data and learning parameters; d) Plot the network graphs; e) Perform Markov chain Monte Carlo computations and produce graphs for posteriors checks. The package refers to one reference item, which describes the methods and algorithms: Vuong, Quan-Hoang and La, Viet-Phuong (2019) <doi:10.31219/osf.io/w5dx6> The 'bayesvl' R package.
